Plank is the controller that manages the job execution and lifecycle for jobs running in k8s.

### Usage

```bash
go run ./prow/cmd/prow-controller-manager --help
```

### Configuration

GCS and S3 are supported as the job log storage.

```yaml
# config.yaml

plank:
  # used to link to job results for decorated jobs (with pod utilities)
  job_url_prefix_config:
    '*': https://<domain>/view
  # used to link to job results for non decorated jobs (without pod utilities)
  job_url_template: 'https://<domain>/view/<bucket-name>/pr-logs/pull/{{.Spec.Refs.Repo}}/{{with index .Spec.Refs.Pulls 0}}{{.Number}}{{end}}/{{.Spec.Job}}/{{.Status.BuildID}}'
  report_template: '[Full PR test history](https://<domain>/pr-history?org={{.Spec.Refs.Org}}&repo={{.Spec.Refs.Repo}}&pr={{with index .Spec.Refs.Pulls 0}}{{.Number}}{{end}})'
  default_decoration_config_entries:
  # All entries that match a job are used, later entries override previous values.
  # Omission of 'repo' and 'cluster' fields makes this entry match all jobs.
  - config:
      timeout: 4h
      grace_period: 15s
      utility_images: # pull specs for container images used to construct job pods
