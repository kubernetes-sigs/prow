`phony` sends fake GitHub webhooks.

## Running a GitHub event manager

`phony` is most commonly used for testing [`hook`](/docs/components/core/hook/) and its [plugins](/docs/components/plugins/), but can be used for testing any externally exposed service configured to receive GitHub events (external plugins).

To get an idea of `phony`'s behavior, start a local instance of `hook` with
this:

```
go run prow/cmd/hook/main.go \
 --config-path=config/prow/config.yaml \
 --plugin-config=config/prow/plugins.yaml \
 --hmac-secret-file=path/to/hmac \
 --github-token-path=path/to/github-token

# Note:
# --hmac-secret-file is required for running locally, use the same hmac token for phony below
```

## Usage

Once you have a running server that manages github webhook events, generate an
`hmac` token (same process as in [prow](/docs/overview/)), and point a `phony` pull
request event at it with the following:

```
phony --help
Usage of ./phony:
  -address string
     Where to send the fake hook. (default "http://localhost:8888/hook")
  -event string
     Type of event to send, such as pull_request. (default "ping")
  -hmac string
     HMAC token to sign payload with. (default "abcde12345")
  -payload string
     File to send as payload. If unspecified, sends "{}".
```

If you are testing `hook` and successfully sent the webhook from `phony`, you should see a log from `hook` resembling the following:

```
{"author":"","component":"hook","event-GUID":"GUID","event-type":"pull_request","level":"info","msg":"Pull request .","org":"","pr":0,"repo":"","time":"2018-05-29T11:38:57-07:00","url":""}
```

A list of supported events can be found in the [GitHub API Docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/). Some example event payloads can be found in the [`examples`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/cmd/phony/examples) directory.
