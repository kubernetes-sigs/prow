## Running Deck locally

Deck can be run locally by executing `./prow/cmd/deck/runlocal`. The scripts starts Deck via
Bazel using:

* pre-generated data (extracted from a running Prow instance)
* the local `config.yaml`
* the local static files, template files and lenses

Open your browser and go to: <http://localhost:8080>

## Debugging via Intellij / VSCode

This section describes how to debug Deck locally by running it inside 
VSCode or Intellij.

```bash
# Prepare assets
make -C prow build-tarball PROW_IMAGE=prow/cmd/deck
mkdir -p /tmp/deck
tar -xvf ./_bin/deck.tar -C /tmp/deck 
cd /tmp/deck
# Expand all layers
for tar in *.tar.gz; do tar -xvf $tar; done

# Start Deck via go or in your IDE with the following arguments:
--config-path=./config/prow/config.yaml
--job-config-path=./config/jobs
--hook-url=http://prow.k8s.io
--spyglass
--template-files-location=/tmp/deck/var/run/ko/template
--static-files-location=/tmp/deck/var/run/ko/static
--spyglass-files-location=/tmp/deck/var/run/ko/lenses
```

## Rerun Prow Job via Prow UI

Rerun prow job can be done by visiting prow UI, locate prow job and rerun job by clicking on the ↻ button, selecting a configuration option, and then clicking `Rerun` button. For prow on github, the permission is controlled by github membership, and configured as part of deck configuration, see [`rerun_auth_configs`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/0dfe42533307f9733f22d4a6abf08e1df2229fcb/config/prow/config.yaml#L92) for k8s prow.

See example below:

Rerunning can also be done on Spyglass:

This is also available for non github prow if the frontend is secured and [`allow_anyone`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/95cc9f4b68d0ce5702c3b3e009221de0fe0a482a/prow/apis/prowjobs/v1/types.go#L190-L191) is set to true for the job.

## Abort Prow Job via Prow UI

Aborting a prow job can be done by visiting the prow UI, locate the prow job and abort the job by clicking on the ✕ button, and then clicking `Confirm` button. For prow on github, the permission is controlled by github membership, and configured as part of deck configuration, see [`rerun_auth_configs`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/0dfe42533307f9733f22d4a6abf08e1df2229fcb/config/prow/config.yaml#L92) for k8s prow. Note, the abort functionality uses the same field as rerun for permissions.

See example below:

Aborting can also be done on Spyglass:

This is also available for non github prow if the frontend is secured and [`allow_anyone`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/95cc9f4b68d0ce5702c3b3e009221de0fe0a482a/prow/apis/prowjobs/v1/types.go#L190-L191) is set to true for the job.
