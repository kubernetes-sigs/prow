# Prometheus Metrics

Some Prow components expose Prometheus metrics that can be used for monitoring
and alerting. The following table describes the metrics that are currently
available.

## Pushgateway and Proxy

To support metric collection from ephemeral tasks like request handling and to
provide a single scrape endpoint, Prow's prometheus metrics are pushed to a
Prometheus pushgateway that is scraped instead of the metric source. A proxy is
used to limit cluster external requests to GET requests since Prometheus doesn't
provide any form of authentication. The pushgateway and proxy deployment are
defined in [`pushgateway_deployment.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/config/prow/cluster/pushgateway_deployment.yaml).

## Kubernetes Prow Metrics

Prometheus metrics from the Kubernetes Prow instance are used to create the
graphs at http://monitoring.prow.k8s.io
